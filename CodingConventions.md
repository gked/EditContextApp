# Coding Conventions
## Architectural Principles
* No frameworks. Author code using Web Components technologies where applicable.
* Write JavaScript code using ES6 features (classes not functions).
* Employ private variables in classes.
* Place code into ES6 modules.
* Use JSON, CSS and HTML experimental module types where applicable.
* Build scripts should be optional, i.e. an F5 refresh loop should facilitate testing.
* Build scripts should be written with Node using --experimental-modules features.
